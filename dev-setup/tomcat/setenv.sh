# Full Tenured heap. The Young space is collected in parallel, but the
# Tenured is not. This means that at a time of load if a full collection
# event occurs, since the event is a 'stop-the-world' serial event then
# all application threads other than the garbage collector thread are
# taken off the CPU. This can have severe consequences if requests continue
# to accrue during these 'outage' periods. (specifically webservices, webapps)
